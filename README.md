# Redux/React Demo
This is a demonstration of using Redux, Redux-Thunk, and React to handle synchronous and asyncronous requests. It provides initial state, thunk dispatcher, actions, reducers, and react-redux to complete the data round trip.

Reducers protect state by always returning a copy of state, never mutating state.
